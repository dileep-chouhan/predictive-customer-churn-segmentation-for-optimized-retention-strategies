# Predictive Customer Churn Segmentation for Optimized Retention Strategies

**Overview:**

This project analyzes transactional and behavioral data from a retail business to identify customer segments at high risk of churn.  The analysis employs machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their likelihood of churning, enabling the development of targeted retention strategies to improve customer lifetime value.  The project utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to achieve this goal.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including details about the identified customer segments and their churn probabilities.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `churn_probability_distribution.png`, `segment_characteristics.png`) illustrating the results of the analysis. These files will be saved in the project's directory.  The specific output will depend on the dataset used.


**Data:**

The project requires a properly formatted CSV file containing customer transactional and behavioral data.  A sample dataset (if available) can be found in the `data` folder.  The expected format should include columns representing customer IDs, purchase history, frequency of purchases, recency of purchase, and any other relevant behavioral features.  Please refer to the `data_dictionary.txt` file (if available) for detailed information on the data columns.


**Future Improvements:**

* Incorporate more advanced modeling techniques.
* Explore different feature engineering approaches.
* Develop a user interface for easier interaction.
* Integrate with a CRM system for seamless deployment.
